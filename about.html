<h2>About Us</h2>
<p class="about_us_p">
  Codebyte studios is a three person indie game development studio. Currently we seem to be focused on making games that are simple in nature but new and
  unique to us. Rather we are trying a new concept or a different/new platform to work on or even just doing something that we have been
  itching to try we are always up to something. Our current project is working with WebGL to make a fun survival zombie game. You can read more about that
