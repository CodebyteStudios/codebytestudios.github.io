title: First Post and Website

With the use of Jekyll and third-party APIs we have started work on a brand new website design. We are using Jekyll and Disqus at the moment to provide a blog and a commenting system respectivly.

Currently the site has a simplistic blogging system on it, and what we think, our websites final layout. The next step is to work on polishing up the design and adding more to the blogging system. A new blog post will be put up as soon as we get some major updates on either the site or the game.
