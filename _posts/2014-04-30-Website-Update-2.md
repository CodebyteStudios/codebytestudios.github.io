title: Website Update #2
---

The website has come a long way since the last post 6 days ago. I have changed the way a blog is displayed on the main page. We think the addition of the "Date ribbon" adds to the site and the post quite a lot.

The next thing that we added was a contact form. The form is very simple and works great. We decided to use Ajax to submit the form so you wouldn't need to redirect or have the page reload when you submitted the form.

Future Plans: </br >
1. Social Media Integration </br >
2. About Us Page </br >
3. Team Page </br >
