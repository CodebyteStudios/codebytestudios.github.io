Our newest project is a 2D zombie survival horror game. Yes, zombies, cliche. But we hope ours will add new mechanics and gameplay style to the already popular zombie games.

Currently our project has basic zombie AI in place, a working inventory system, player movement including sprinting and stamina for duration of sprinting allowed, and finally a working health system for both the player and the zombies.

Right now we are working on lighting for the game to provide a day/night cycle plus other lighting features. The day/night cycle plays an important role in our game and not just the usual, "More zombies at night and harder...blah blah blah".
