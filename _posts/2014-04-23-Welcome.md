title: Welcome - Thank You!

Thank you for visiting the Codebyte Studios website. After a major redesign of the first planned release of the website we are proud to officially show this one off...

With the use of Jekyll and third-party APIs we are able to bring you the site you see today. Jekyll has allowed us to provide a blog on a completely static website and Disqus provides us with free commenting services. In addition to both of these we have intergrated social media so you can share different areas of the site on your favorite social media services.

The reason we decided to release this website much earlier than we have even produced a game is to allow people to follow along with our development process and hopefully be a part of that. Our goal is to provide frequent blog post updates via the site and share their links over our social media pages so everyone can keep up with the different projects we may be working on at the time. We are always open to suggestions about how we can improve the website or how we can improve or change certain aspects of the projects we talk about in these blogs.
